This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: improper error handling within asynchronous operations.  The `bug.js` file showcases the issue, where a promise rejection during an asynchronous operation is not handled gracefully, potentially leading to silent failures.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with appropriate error handling, ensuring a more robust and reliable application.
